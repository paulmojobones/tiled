 Building
----------

To make libtiled.jar, install Ant (http://ant.apache.org/), and run the
following command:
$ ant jar

To run all unit-tests, run the following command:
$ ant test
Running unit-tests requires you to have ant-junit.jar in your classpath. This
is usually installed by the default Ant install, but some OS:es refer to that
as the "ant-optional" package.
